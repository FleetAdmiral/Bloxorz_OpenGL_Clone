Extra features:
1) Multisampling/MSAA/Anti aliasing
2) Sound (will compile and work only on linux) - when you move the box and when
the game starts.
Usage:
1) Use arrow keys to move about in every view.
2) Change the view type by pressing 'x' (toggle through them).
3) The 2 blue bricks are the switches, press the blue switch near the big 'island'
of tiles (that also has the goal hole) to open the bridge and press the other
one to close it.
Notes:
1) Bricks are not assumed to fall if only one face is without support.
